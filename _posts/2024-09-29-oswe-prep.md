I am planning to go for OSWE sometime next year, for that i need to have a plan. I will use this blog to document all the resources i come around for the preparation of OSWE.

My Idea is that for next 7-8 Months i will prepare with all the free resources available and after that i will go for paid resources such as pentesterlab, htb.

### Vulnerable labs i found on github

My approach is simple for this section - 

1) Don't read walkthrough for these labs.
2) Exploit each vuln present, and write a python script to automate the exploit.
3) DO NOT USE CLAUDE OR GPT IN THIS PROCESS.
4) Document the entire process and write a blog on the same.
5) Update this sheet overtime.
