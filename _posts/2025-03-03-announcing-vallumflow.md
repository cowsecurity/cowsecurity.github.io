Yo, finally got vallumflow out the door. Been heads-down coding this thing for months and today we're opening the waitlist.

So what's vallumflow? Basically it's fixing that whole mess where security and development teams fight with each other. You've seen it - security creates these processes that slow everything down, devs hate them, everyone gets annoyed, and somehow stuff still gets hacked anyway.

Been dealing with this headache from both sides. When I was coding, I hated waiting for security approvals. When I ran security, I couldn't keep track of all our assets. The whole system's broken.

Vallumflow is our crack at solving this. It's a workflow platform that handles asset management, CI/CD security checks, and endpoint stuff all in one place. But with no coding required to set up the workflows.

The main things we built:
- A workflow builder where you drag and drop security processes (seriously, no code needed)
- One dashboard instead of jumping between 20 different security tools
- Integrations with pretty much everything in your stack
- Smart prioritization so you don't waste time on low-risk stuff

If you're tired of security being this big blocker that slows everything down, head over to [vallumflow.com](https://vallumflow.com) and jump on the waitlist.

Oh, and we set up a Discord where you can see what we're building, give feedback, tell us what to fix, whatever: [https://discord.gg/JXPrJsab](https://discord.gg/JXPrJsab)

This is just the start. Got a ton of features in the pipeline. Been testing it with a few teams and the feedback's been solid so far. If you've got questions, hit me up on Discord or shoot an email to contact@vallumflow.com.

Let's see if we can make security not suck for once.

Later,
- Cowsecurity
