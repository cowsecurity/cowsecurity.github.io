I build stuff that makes security tools work better. Mostly because I got tired of doing things manually and thought "there's gotta be a better way." When I'm not coding, I'm probably tinkering with some new tech or binge-watching anime.

What I'm Up To
======
* Building some cool security tools (trust me, they're cooler than they sound)
* Playing with AI (because why not?)
* Breaking things (professionally, of course)
* Making life easier for fellow security folks

Let's Connect!
======
Got ideas? Want to collaborate? Or just want to chat about the latest anime? Find me on discord (cow.security)

When I'm Not Coding
======
You'll find me:
* Watching anime
* Debating tech stuff on Discord
* Probably procrastinating on Twitter
* Learning something new (or at least trying to)
