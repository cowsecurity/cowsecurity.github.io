I'm Cowsecurity, a security engineer from India with a knack for finding vulnerabilities and an unhealthy obsession with anime.

About This Security Nerd
======
I'm a versatile security professional with expertise in multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Go, PHP, and OCaml. My skill set allows me to approach security challenges from various angles, whether it's hardening applications, securing cloud infrastructures, or developing robust security solutions.

My Arsenal
======
* Application Security (Because someone has to keep developers honest)
* Cloud Security (Head in the clouds, feet firmly on the ground)
* Penetration Testing (It's exactly what it sounds like, and nothing like what you're thinking)
* Security Lab Development (Where I play mad scientist, legally)
* I speak fluent Machine
